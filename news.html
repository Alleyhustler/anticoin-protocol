        <h2>Changelog</h2>
       <br> 
       <p>7/16/25 - Added Wayback links for each of the games on the <a href="freeonline.html">PFOG</a> page. I want to focus on making the old web more accessible. Alot of it has been preserved but you really have to know where to look to find sites. </p>
       <p>7/2/25 to 7/15/25  - Just minor adjustments to the flashpage and Webdivers. Mostly porting over the changes in my offline build to condense everything. oh I also added a new project to Gina's Code Korner.</p>
       <p>7/1/25 - Added Kitten Burst and Clair Obsucr to Recent Plays. Added Kitten Burst to The 0451 Conspiracy </p>
       <p>6/x/25 to 6/xx/25 - Final sprint for the secret code page, now called <a href="The_0451_Conspiracy.html">The 0451 Conspiracy</a>. Added a bunch of instances I found. Was starting to get tired of that project so I did a mad rush playing through games I suspected had the code. Not sure what to do next as I've been burnt out for months now.</p>
       <p>3/21/25 - Starting to get a hang of Bryce 3D. Having trouble with resolution stuff and animation but otherwise going well!</p>
       <p>3/18/25 - Been messing around with Bryce 3D in a VM. Might commit to it. I want to make cool wallpapers to distribute on the site!</p>
       <p>1/23/25 to 1/31/25 - Added a bunch of games to the secret code page </p>
        <p style="display: inline-block;">1/22/25 - Commissioned a con badge by <a href="https://www.catboyriot.net/"><img src="commissionedWork/Catboyriot_8fps.gif"></a> He even drew it on a subway ticket; now that's punk! Check it out on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page! </p>
       <p> 1/20/25 - Added Gloomwood to the secret code page </p>
       <p>1/10/25 - Got laid off from my job because they were growing and wanted to cut costs. 5 years gone in a 5 minute call </p>
       <p style="display: inline-block;">1/6/25 - Added a section for artwork I've commissioned to the <a href="about.html">About</a> page. Visit to check out a piece by Neo-neighbor, <div style="background-image: linear-gradient( green, yellow, violet, cyan);-webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-family: cursive; display:inline-block;"> Corrupted Unicorn! </div> <a href="https://corruptedunicorn.neocities.org/"><img src="commissionedWork/corruptedbuttgif.gif" height="43px"></a></p>

       <p>9/5/24 - Started work on a Germs Nerawareta Machi page. It's very W.I.P; my first priority was to design the page based on the game's computer interface. </p>
