  <h1>Intro</h1>
 
 
  <p>You wouldn't download a car! Growing up on the still developing internet of the 00's, you aren't really aware of the complexities and techniques of web surfing. Typing free online games and clicking that download button seems like a solid idea, until the computer bursts into flames! Needless to say, you learn fast.. kinda. I still managed to get a few viruses, but I could get things up and running agian in a days time! Eventually, after lots of trial and error I managed to come across "Play Free Online Games". The name does not do much to inspire confidence, but it delivered exactly what it said. Instead of being some shady site that redistributed download files, it instead acted as a directory and supplied links to the official hosts of various free games published on the net. I would use this site for years, I must have played a good 50% of the games listed! Granted, I never played any of them for very long. It was like a wine tasting, except each wine demanded my email address. For that reason, I'l keep my thoughts on these games brief.

Its one of those limited actions per day kind of games where you manage energy, health, money and skills. The draw is that you are little alien dude in an alien city. Its got all your staples; doll avatars, HTML heavy interactions, gambling, fishing, crime, etc. I kinda miss games like that; Its still around so maybe Ill make an account and give it another shot sometime!</p> </td><tr> <td style="background-color:black;"></td> <td>Wayback archive: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182615/http://www.alienaa.com/">September 2007</a></td></tr></table>'
