<h1>NetSpeak Basics!</h1>
<p>*COMING SOON* This will be a section dedicated to giving brief overveiws of different typing styles found around the net. It won't be comprehenive as many of these styles dont have formalized names or guidelines! </p>

<div class="textcontainerD">
    <ul>
        <h2>1337 Sp34K (leetspeak)</h2>
        <li>At its most basic operation, leetspeak replaces English characters with their visually closest related number or symbol. The simplest ones to catch are I = 1, E = 3, and T = 7.
        
    L337 has a rich history on the net, primarily originating in hacker circles. One for its cool look and another more practical as it makes searching for things you may want to hide more difficult.</li>
        
        <p>Ex: searching up "Cracked CD" wouldn't bring up "Cr4ck3D (d"</p>       
        <p>Additional considerations: When writing in 1337, variety is key! Some words can be written entirely without an english character while others can be mixed. It's also common to randomly switch between capital and lowercase. You can also use shorthand or even intentionally mispel! The sky's the limit as long as you can get your point across!</p>  
        <p> Ex: D1s T0O c4n /|\4K3 U lQok |1Ke 4 1337 HaXx0Rz </p>
