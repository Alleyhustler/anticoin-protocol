  <h2> Background </h2>
  
  <p>   
    For the first issue of WebDivers we will be taking a look at a now defunct digital distribution platform, Desura.   
    </p>
  
    <p>   
      Officially released by DBolical Pty in 2011, Desura sought out to create a platform that focused on the distribution of indie games and mods; in essence, building upon their other two projects, ModDB and IndieDB. While Steam had already started to distribute indie games years prior, their vetting process made it difficult for fledgling creators to get their games to market. For a while, it seemed like Desura had been successful in making indie game development and distribution more accessible but with the release of Steam Greenlight in 2012 and several buyouts, the platform quickly declined and was officially shut down in 2016. 
    </p>

  <h2> UI/Layout </h2>
  
  
  <p> Desura's palette consisted primarily of blue, white, gray and black; going for a sleek cyber kind of aesthetic. Those familiar with ModDB may notice that the layout of the sites are practically the same, save for some minor differences. 
    </p>

  <p>Like most digital distribution services, Desura also had a desktop client. The only depictions I could find were on a blog post regarding the client's development on Linux systems and a skin that added a red palette. This mostly functioned as a mirror to their website with the exception of the owned games/mod library which had it's own UI and custom download interface.</p>

  <p> Having access to ModDB's vast collection of mods; it was a no-brainier to utilize the Desura client and streamline the process by allowing users to download mods straight into their game directories.

  <h2> Alphafunding  </h2>
  
  <p> 
    One of the more unique features of Desura, was their Alphafunding program. This allowed developers to sell their games while they were still in the alpha/beta stages. Sure, it's a risk to buy something that's not finished (and may never be) but for the most part, the program was well-received; supporters get to play the latest builds, the developer gets necessary funding and what is essentially free player feedback and play testing! 
  
    </p>

  <p> 
    Maybe it's because of the archive, but outside of the "alphafunding" section under the games page, Desura did not seem to assign any special tags to games that were in the program. Only by going to the game's page and checking the description or purchase options could you see them marked (by the developer) as Alpha/Beta.

  <h2> The Decline</h2>
  According to an archived blog post, Desura was sold off to Linden Lab, the developer behind Second Life, in July of 2013. Despite this, Desura kept operating as it was with a steady release of new games and alphafunding projects.   </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraLinden.png" width="600px">
  <h5>Desura linden Lab aqquistion blog post; July, 2013 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130712015927/http://www.desura.com/groups/desura/news/linden-lab-acquires-desura">(Wayback link)</h5> </a>
  
  <br>
  <p> This normality, however, was short lived. Starting sometime in September of 2014; Linden Lab teases "Desura V2" which completely redesigned the store page and unlisted the mod page. (Note - the new store display does not function within the archives)</p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraV2.png" width="600px">
  <h5>Desura V2; September, 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140926235300/http://www.desura.com/">(Wayback link)</h5> </a>
  <p>I was unable to find any reference to this decision on the archive before or after; but for whatever reason and seemingly without any notice, Linden Lab sold Desura to Bad Juju Games sometime in November of 2014. Bad JuJu was quick to re-brand much of Desura's original design by swapping out the blue highlights with red, and switching the diamond logo to a little red alien mascot. I think it's pretty cute x3!  </p>

  <p>Cute redesign aside, it did not take long for things to go sour. Developers started to complain that they were not being paid the revenues from their sales; resulting in rumors that Desura was in a "financial crisis". This prompted an official response from their team in May of 2015. The comments left on this post offer a lot of insight on the whole ordeal. As it turns out, management had been withholding information from Desura staff and things were just as bad as the community had assumed; Bad JuJu was going bankrupt. </p>

  <p>This was the last statement and post made on the Desura blog before the company declared bankruptcy in June of 2015. The service was officially shut down in October of 2016 when OnePlay bought out the entire Desura brand.  </p>

  <p> From there, it looks like Desura pops up again in 2017 and 2018, but the archives are so bare and broken, that I can only assume they were failed attempts at relaunching the service. You can even find Bad JuJu still listed in the copyright XD! Skip ahead to 2020 and Desura is merely a shell being worn by a slug who found it while scavenging through long abandoned ruins. The site now hosts a variety of dubious looking online games, and I'm not clickin' on any of them to find out anymore than that! </p>

  <p>So there you have it, the life and death of video game distribution platform, Desura. Despite how poorly things went, I still think they were an important part of indie game distribution history; paving the way for the now industry standard of releasing games in active development (for better or worse). </p>

The game was released to Desura in mid 2011 as a part of the Alphafunding program and later re-released under Steam's Greenlight/Early Access programs in 2013. It has since been in activate development  </p>

  <p> Project Zomboid was how I first found out about Desura, it was basically their flagship game in the Alphafunding program. It was immediately well received for it's fresh take on the then emerging zombie survival genre; focusing on the player character's physical and mental well-being while not skimping out on your survival staples; base building, resource management, crafting, etc. </p>

  <p>This immediate praise was thanks to the first alpha-build/demo known as "Til Death Us Do Part" which showcased much of what the game had to offer, even this early in development. Til Death Us Do Part followed an introductory story of a husband and his recently injured wife some amount of time into the zombie apocalypse. By taking care of her, you go through the game's basic mechanics of fortifying the house, performing first-aid, managing needs, and of course, combat. I was obsessed with this demo, playing through countless times trying to survive for as long as I could! It also didn't help that shortly after the demo's release, a youtuber I follow, Marphy Black, made this video where they changed the in-game models to be L4D characters and edited their voice lines over gameplay XD. These kind of videos still hold a place in my heart x3! </p>

  <p>Looking back on this demo, it's amazing to see how far the game has come while still remaining true to their earliest concept! Some major additions are as follows:
    <p>First and foremost; Multiplayer has been added so you can survive with your friends! Playing with some friends of mine recently, led to a discussion about the history of the game; this is actually what sparked my memory of Desura and inspired me to create WebDivers in the first place! </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/PZWaltuh.png" height="420px">

  <p> Project Zomboid has been in development for about 11 years now. It still has a long way to go before the devs will consider it finished; but I'd say it's been a success nonetheless! Sure, some features like NPCs seem to be indefinitely delayed, but I'm not going to fault them for being ambitious. I still have a great time every time I play and it always feels just as fresh and exciting as that little old demo I played all those years ago! </p>

    document.getElementById("FortZombie").innerHTML = `<p> Fort Zombie is a zombie survival RPG Developed by Kerberos Productions. The game released to GamersGate and Direct-2-Drive in 2009, Desura in 2011, and later re-released on Steam in 2018. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/FortZombie.png">
  <h5>Fort Zombie Website; December, 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091214221003/http://www.fortzombie.com/">(Wayback link)</h5> </a>
  <p> Fort Zombie was one of the more notorious games I had played on Desura. As far as I can tell, it was never updated since its initial 2009 release; leaving the game poorly optimized, poorly balanced and bug ridden. Despite these shortcomings, Fort Zombie spawned a small cult following, praising the game's attempt to create an, at the time, non-typical zombie game with more in-depth looting and management mechanics. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortZombie1.png" width="700px">
  <h5>Fort Zombie page; July, 2011 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704203750/http://www.desura.com/games/fort-zombie">(Wayback link)</h5> </a>
  
  
    <p> The game follows Ben Riley, a blank slate who learns that a horde of zombies will arrive in the town of Piety in 13 days. Your goal is to set up a base in one of three buildings and gather enough survivors and supplies to fight off the horde on the final day. You start the game by determining Ben's profession (starting skills and stats) and the building you would like to setup your fort in (difficulty). </p>
   
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortBen.jpg" height="450px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraForts.jpg" height="450px">
  
    <p> Once your choices are made, you will be dropped on a corner of a randomly generated map in a small tutorial area. This is where you will be given your first weapons; a crowbar, revolver and pistol. Your goal is to fight your way through town to reach your selected fort location, which is always located on the opposite side of the map. </p>
  
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortTut.jpg" width="430px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortTutInv.jpg" width="430px"> 
  
  <p>For me, this was the biggest hurdle of the game; once you leave that tutorial area, you will be facing every challenge the game can pose while at your least equipped. Combat is hard to avoid and zombies often come in large groups. Some zombies even have unique abilities that can make things even more dangerous. Most notable are the EMT/Doctor zombies which put any zombies you've already killed back together, and Cop/Soldier zombies that can still use their guns and deal MASSIVE damage at a distance.</p>
  
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortCombat.jpg" width="380px"> 
  
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortRevive.gif" width="420px"> 
  
  <p>The game's problems become really clear during this uphill battle. For one, the camera is a weird mix between 3rd person and an overhead view, this makes aiming very awkward as your shot is relative to the position of Ben's center and the height of what you are aiming at. It's hard to put into words, here's some gifs XD. (Sorry about the dithering, GIFs are expensive you know :/ )  </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortBehindShot.gif" width="420px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortOverheadShot.gif" width="420px"> 
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortTwist.gif" width="500px"> 
  <p>It's also worth noting that all attacks not only depend on your aim and positioning but also on a skill roll calculation if you hit or not (think Morrowind, if you are familiar). This adds another layer of difficulty; and will really put your starting build to the test.  </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortMiss.gif" width="420px"> 
  
  <p>My best strat so far has been to select the police officer profession due to their proficiently in clubs; this will make your crowbar very powerful (theoretical physicist approved!). While your stamina is limited and difficult to manage during combat as overexerting will prevent all melee and running for a significant amount of time; your melee attacks can hit several enemies in one swing, making it a worthwhile risk! With enough skill, you will be grinding your way through walls of zombies, unless of course they have guns... Never bring a crowbar to a gunfight. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortFreeman.gif" width="420px"> 
  
  
   <p>On your way to the fort, you'll want to take some time to loot some buildings for supplies. Looting is real tedious as you can't just walk up to a fridge and open it. You have to hold down F which triggers this radial search animation. If you're lucky, you will hear a ping noise and a container will be highlighted which will allow you to loot it. The problem with this is that it's hard to tell what objects even have a chance to be looted in the first place and how accurate the radius is. You end up having to perform this action in every nook and cranny before you can determine if you've cleaned the place out. Since the maps are randomly generated, you really have to keep track of prefabs to know what's worth searching near. For example; in one particular house prefab, there will be a pile of military crates on the second floor which will almost always have guns and ammo. </p>
   <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortSearch.gif" width="430px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortGunStash.jpg" width="430px">
  
  <p>Once you get to the fort and clear it of any stragglers, the real game begins. You will now have access to your fort management menu. This is where you can undertake missions, build defenses, manage resources, assign jobs, etc. You can only save on this screen, so don't forget to do so before heading out or ending the day! The game is prone to crash during load screens so be vigilant!</p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortPolice.jpg" width="560px">
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortSupplies.jpg" width="460px">  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortAssign.jpg" width="460px">
  <p>While at the fort, you can build fortifications and position survivors. In a way, it's almost like setting up in a tower defense game! Putting down fortifications will take time. You will need to assign survivors to it's construction; progress will happen during the end of day report dependent on the related skill of the survivor. This mechanic isn't only for the final battle, when going out on missions or ending the day, there is a chance that the fort will be assaulted by zombies; so always make sure your survivors are well equipped before heading out!</p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortPlacement.jpg" width="430px">   <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortBuild.jpg" width="430px"> 
  
  
  <p> Each day you will be given a selection of possible missions to perform that boil down to either loot this place, or find this survivor. Each mission will take a number of hours to perform depending on it's distance from the fort. You can perform several missions per day, assuming you manage your time correctly.</p> 
  
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortMissions.jpg" width="550px"> 
  
  <p> These missions are not automated; you will be spawned into a newly generated area with the mission's point of interest marked on your compass. Your spawn point will also be your designated exit point, so you'll have to fight your way there and back. You will still have free reign to explore and loot any other buildings in the area, though, only through accepting survivor missions will survivors spawn on the map, you cannot find them otherwise. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/DesuraFortEscape.jpg" width="550px">  
  <p> Any survivors rescued will need to be escorted back to the exit point. You can also bring them with you on missions but they have really bad AI and will most likely end up stuck on something. Still, if you don't mind the risk, they make great portable backpacks! </p>

    <p>NEO Scavenger is a hardcore survival sim developed by Blue Bottle Games. The game was first released to Desura in late 2012 as a part of the alphafunding program, under Steam's Greenlight/Early Access programs in 2013 and later fully released in 2014. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/NeoMain.png" width="700px">
  
  
  <p>I found out about Neo Scavenger not long after it's debut on Desura. It boasted a complex survival simulation within a dynamic world. I've always had an appreciation for games that focus on systems and simulation (even if I'm usually really bad at them >_<) so, it was an easy purchase!

  <p> You play as Phillip Kindred, some guy who wakes up from cryosleep in post-apocalyptic Detroit. Your goal? SURVIVE! And well, maybe figure out who you are, why you were frozen and what happened to the world XD. Before the game starts, you can select from a list of abilities and flaws. Most abilities will aid you in more ways than one; granting unique crafting recipes, looting modifiers, special actions in encounters, etc. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/NeoTrait.png" width="700px">
  
    <p> Unlike what Todd Howard would lead to you believe, coming fresh out of cryo into an inhospitable wasteland where everything's out to get ya is no easy task! As soon as you wake up, a werewolf like creature known as a dogman will attempt to enter the facility. Luckily, most of your skills will spare you from a combat encounter which would have surely left you dead in seconds. Okay cool, so If I avoid dogmen, I should be good? WRONG! Need I remind you that you just came out of a cryo tube? You're practically naked, you have no food or water, it's freezing outside and society has collapsed; good luck! </p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/NeoCryo.png" width="700px"> 
  
  
      <p> Once you exit the facility, you will be at the mercy of the world and your own body. The game world operates on a turn-based hexagonal grid system. During each turn you can travel, scavenge, rest, etc. After each turn, an hour will pass and NPCS will take their actions. This world is fully dynamic, so NPCs will also be scavenging and looting to survive; more likely than not, that means killing you! The wilderness survival aspect plays into this dynamic, when you move a grid space, you will leave tracks; so if you know an NPC is in the area, you should spend some of your action points on covering them and hiding to avoid combat! </p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/NeoMap.png" width="700px"> 
      <p>As the world is dynamic, you can also expect to have unique unscripted encounters. In the only screenshot I could find saved from the game's 2013 build, I had just fought off a looter, when I noticed that I was luckier than his last victim. On the tile, were the remnants of a rotten human corpse. I think I said it best by naming the screenshot "jesus,what happend here 0_0 all this human meats". </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Neo2013.png" width="700px">
  <p>The previous screenshot also showcases the game's grid based inventory. The left side are items on the hex while the right shows what you are carrying + inventory space from backpacks, pockets and other carried bags (satchels, hand-held bags and boxes, etc). I love a good grid inventory! Seriously, I like to take my time and try my darnedest to optimize every item I'm carrying to hopefully squeeze in a few more! You can even rotate individual items! But be warned, this is still a survival sim; even if you could fit 15 water bottles into your backpack, it's going to weigh you down!</p>
  
      <p>The UI of Neo Scavenger can feel a little bit clunky as most of it is built around inventory and inventory like systems. For example; during combat encounters, actions must be first selected in one "inventory" box, moved to another "inventory" box and then confirmed by pressing the submit button. While cumbersome, I find it endearing! If you can't tell from the way I make things, I appreciate honest designs like this; they may not be streamlined or convenient, but they showcase the individuality and inventiveness of their creators working within their own bounds.</p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/NeoCombat.png" width="700px">
  
      <p>Between my Desura copy and Steam copy, I've probably played around 25-35ish total hours as of writing this. Within this time, I've barely ever survived for more than an in-game week and have made little progress in any of the game's quests outside of smaller self-contained random encounters. The game is really unforgiving, so I can't say I'd recommend it if you aren't already accustomed to the genre. Still, despite being crap at it, I still find myself loading it up for a quick game every once in a blue moon. It's a game that's hard to put down while your playing; but easy to quit when you die XD. Maybe someday I'll get to the bottom of Neo Scavenger's story.. maybe.  <p>

  <p>Incognito was an episodic multi-genre game developed by Magrathean Technologies. Episode 1 was originally released in 2008, with Episode 2 and 3 being released in 2010. These episodes were initially only available for purchase on their website until the game later released to Desura in December 7th of 2010, however, this was during Desura's private beta, meaning they would not be officially available to the public until the 2011 unveiling of the platform. A prologue (episode 0) was later added to the game in 2012. And finally, sometime around 2015, the game was bundled into a single package and released to Steam.</p>

  <p>Incognito, despite being one of the earliest games you could find on the platform, ended up being an obscurity, with little in the way of comments or veiws. Luckily I found myself on Desura quite early to it's release, so this was on my radar from the start! </p>

  <p> I'll be honest, my memory of Incognito has been nil to nothing, I didn't even remember the name of it until writing this! All I could remember was that the game put a focus on the periodic table, there were robots and everything was dark. My younger self barely made any progress before giving up. Yet, since Desura's end, I've always found myself thinking of Incognito, regretful that I never gave it a fair shot. </p>

    <p>Outside of the archives I could find nothing on the game; it's not even available on Steam anymore! I was desperate to get my hands on a copy; I scoured the net for old steam keys hoping to get lucky. I found a few options but they were going for an upwards of $100! Just when I thought about giving up on this dive, I was able to find a key on Fanatical for about 7 bucks! Further investigation revealed that these were keys from an old Bundle Stars bundle. Honestly, to think that this would be the only thing that preserved a copy of a game that's practically been erased from history! More on why that is later, for now let's take this chance opportunity and document as much as we can!</p>

  <h3> Multi-genre drifting?! </h3>
  <p> The main selling point of Incognito was that it was multi-genre; specifically blending FPS and RTS mechanics into it's linear story. Multi-genre games like this are actually not as unusual as you might think! Games like Parkan, Space Rangers, Executive Assault, Nuclear Dawn, Mount and Blade and even mods like Source Engine's Empires, all seek to blend traditional action genres with stratagy elements. I particularly like games that do this, though I must admit, they usually end up a bit rough around the edges (y'know, Jack of all trades, master of none). </p>

  <h5> FPS </h4>
      <p> First and foremost are the FPS sections. This is where the majority of the game takes place as this also encompasses most non-combat interactions such as dialogue. Overall, the combat itself is very rudimentary but I found it enjoyable. There are (to my knowledge) 5 total weapons; A light pistol (which should really be called a heavy pistol since it has a slow fire rate and deals massive damage!), a machine gun, a shotgun (which is literally just a normal shotgun, not like the other sc-fi weapons), a railgun and of course a rocket launcher! </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogWep.gif">
      <p>While in FPS mode, You will have access to an inventory with items looted from containers and corpses. This is standard fare, though most items are junk outside of ammo, quest and healing items. At this point, you might have noticed many elements of Incognito take heavy influence from System Shock, from the UI to the story. The game even uses a variety of sounds directly from SS2! These files are held in a folder named "TriOp" within the game's directory. TriOp being a reference to the SS2's TriOptimum Corporation.  <p>
        <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogInv.png" width="430px">
        <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogMenu2.jpg" width="430px"> 
       <p>Like both System Shock games, You can even find data pads with mini-games to play!</p>
        <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogMini1.png" height="250px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogMini2.png"height="250px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogMini3.png" height="250px">
      <p> Sometimes during FPS segments,  you will need to hack a door or console to progress. This starts a mini-game where you will need to spell out a word using a random assortment of letters. 
        Unlike standard anagrams, you won't have to use every letter. You can also press "crack" to list out every possible word combination and just select one from there. The tip implies that you need to solve for a specific word by process of elimination but I've gone through the mini-game a couple dozen times and I never had to solve for more than one word to succeed. I solved the one below by typing "Yurt"; there are most definitely better answers than that so I'm going to assume that they simplified this system to make sure it didn't become tedious. I could have sat there for an hour trying to figure it out otherwise XD</p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogHack.png" width="700px">
     
      <h4> Space travel </h4>
        <p>The game takes place in Sector 42, which is a cluster of several star and solar systems. Between missions you will need to navigate the sector to visit specific planets and space stations. For all intents and purposes, this is just a world map; there are no unique space interactions. Which is weird because several story related upgrades are supposedly in relation to your ship (weapons, shields, etc.). You even have hull and temperature stats; but these don't do anything. The only way to die in this mode is if you fly into the sun or an asteroid; but even then, these do not effect the hull stat. </p>

        <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSun.gif">
  
  
      <h4> RTS </h4>
      <p> Next are the RTS segments. These are very bare bones; upon visiting a planet, you can send a probe and 4 tanks to the planet's surface. You will need to order the probe to contruct mines on mineral deposits (hence the periodic table), while making sure your tanks fend off creatures known as "Dust Bunnies". Later in the game you will encounter an enemy fraction which will spawn their own tanks until you destroy their production facilities. You are not able to build your own facilities; so there isn't that push/pull you would expect from the genre. It's also worth noting that resources are only earned while in the RTS mode, your mining facilities do not persist when leaving the planet. Though as discussed in the next section, there is no need to mine for resources outside what is required for story progression. </p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogRTS.jpg" width="600px">
  
     
  
      <h4> Space trading </h4>
        <p>Despite what their website stated, there are no commerce aspects to the game. Which is especially odd since several characters will mention credits and resource trading. There are even "vendors" but everything they "sell" is free to take. Could this have been an unimplemented system? While disappointing,  given how uneventful the RTS segments are; I'm glad that the game focused on story progression without the need to grind or explore.</p>
          <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogTrade.png" width="600px">
        
          
          <h4> Tank missions</h4>
          <p> Lastly, tank segments. You will be placed on a planet's surface with the goal of getting from point A to point B while blasting your way through point C. After the very first tank section which faces you off against Dust Bunnies, the difficulty ramps up with enemy tanks that can deal massive damage in a couple of hits! The best tactic is to take things slow and shoot outside of your enemies' line of sight. Straightforward and not very fun. I'd much rather go to point D away from points A, B and C; however, going out of bounds will result in an instant death!</p>

   <h3> Cut-content?! </h3>
   <p>If you've played Incognito during the Desura era, you may be confused at much of what has been discussed above. As I have discovered after playing through the game several times, digging through the game the game's files and doing more research online; The original release had tons more content that has been inexplicably cut from the Steam version!</p>

    <p>For starters, I was able to track down the game's original trailers on IndieDB. They were included on a blog post made by Magrathean in response to them finding Incognito on two pirating websites. They use this as an opportunity to lower their price and remove all DRM from the game hoping to push any pirates into purchasing a legitimate copy.</p>

    <p>Episode 1's trailer is.. erm rough. It's near impossible to make out what HEIDI is saying over the music. Still, this trailer alone already showcases tons of cut content! I can count 4 new weapon types; a flamethrower, minigun, sniper rifle and assault rifle. We can also see that there were expanded ship mechanics complete with fuel and repairs. Most surprisingly of all is that THERE WAS A FULL FLEDGED RTS SYSTEM!! We can see several different building types, one being a unit production facility with at least 3 unit types. There also appear to be some kind of energy production towers. Maybe this energy was used for building? </p>

  <p>Episode 2's trailer showcases much of what we already know from the Steam version and the previous trailer. However, for a brief couple of seconds at 1:05 we can see a tank being moved by crane; similar to that one scene in Half-Life 2. Shame this was cut, I would have loved to see that in action!

  <p>Episode 3's trailer is not all that different from the episode 3 intro, but we do see a few notable changes and bits of gameplay. It appears that Fox and Wolf would have had more backstory. We see a different weapon model for the rocket launcher though, this model looks much better and more in the style of the game than the one in the steam version. I wonder why they made this change? We can also see that the heavy pistol now has a clip and reloading animation. Most notable, is that there were a selection of melee weapons. Wolf in particular even has a "Mighty Foot" mechanic (A la Duke Nukem 3D). Funnily enough, I was able to find remnants of this in files of the Steam copy, dubbed "MightyWolfFoot".</p>

  <p>With all of these developments, would it be too far off to assume the old build included commerce? While I cannot definitely say how far the mechanic went; based off of single YouTube video, "Incognito God Mode Bug", we can briefly see a cash counter at 0:17! At 1:13, we can also see that loot items had assigned cash values. I'm going to go ahead and assume that merchants were a fully realized mechanic, but element trading as a whole remains unknown. Lastly, there also appears to be an over the sholder camera option at 0:33 I was not able to find this in the Steam version. </p>

  <p> In a review of Episode 1 published by indiegamereviewer in October of 2010, it is revealed that the game had some sort of stat system, expanded planet exploration and was overall much more difficult as the reviewer talks about the unfairness of FPS sections. The thing that stood out to me the most was the mention of an hour long conversation with an NPC called Bob the Devil. I searched through the Steam files and was able to confirm that Bob is actually that weird spinning thing I found in Episode 2. However, there was no way to interact with him and I could find no trace of dialogue in the files. </p>

  <p> Their review of episode 2, published in December of 2010, makes note of different FPS mission types, including the crane segment from the Episode 2 trailer. They don't talk much about other specific places or missions so it's hard to make many comparisons in this review. Though, they do discuss several bugs that I had not encountered in the Steam version; one of which being that an elevator in Sandvich Guy's path bugging out and killing you. This complaint is referenced in a Steam achivment as the elevator in this version is stable. </p>

  </video>
  <p>Episode 0 (The Prologue) functions primarily as a tutorial and sets up the plot of the game. You play as a mechanical man named "Nick the Nose". You and your fellow mechanicals are enslaved to a group known as "The Alliance". Initially your task is to scout a planet for the construction of an Alliance base. This mission introduces you to the RTS element, as you collect resources on the planet's surface.</p>

    <source src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogEp0BriefLQ.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <p>After doing so, the story gets kind of fuzzy, you end up traveling around the system to collect random resources. Uniquely however, is your introduction to the FPS sections. Unlike all future FPS encounters, in this one you are tasked with hacking several enemy mining facilities to steal their resources. It's not a great shooting section by any means, but it's still fun to go through. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogHackMission.jpg" width="440px"> 
  
  <p> Now the story starts to get back on track. The Alliance tells you to investigate an old crash site. After a brief tank section, you board the ship and locate a malfunctioning AI. You bring the AI to the newly constructed Alliance base where it is repaired. The AI introduces herself as HEIDI or Heuristic Intelligence Data Integrator. To make a long story short; 100 years ago, she was created by another AI known as BRICK but was quickly taken down by the Alliance. HEIDI informs you that they have already marked her as a target and that she needs your help to escape. Without warning, HEIDI releases you from Alliance control and into hers. You manage to blast your way out but your crew is killed. As "thanks", HEIDI leaves you on a broken down station where you will take on the role of a bartender to lay low while she finds a human to carry out the next part of her plan.</p>

As soon as you open the first door, you will be swarmed by these little bug looking aliens that make couger noises; this is kind of an unfair fight, but you can shift the balance by fighting your way to a staircase which, for the most part, they wont be able to climb up. </p>

First is Sandvich (Yes, that's how they spell it in the item description; a TF2 reference!) guy. He goes on about how much he loves the sandviches made by Amanda (who does not appear anywhere in the game). You can ask him to rate on a scale from 1-10, how much he loves them; to which he will reply 9000. and in classic 2000's fashion, you can exclaim "What?! Over 9000?!"  </p>

In any case, Max will give you a shotgun if you trade with him. </p>
  
  
  <p>After talking with all the characters, I started to notice how their faces changed expressions during dialogue. It kind of reminded me of Fallout's talking heads! Max also has a unique expression unlike any other in the game. If you tell him about your attempted suicide, he will have one of those anime puff breath icons. </p>

  <p> For the final mission of this episode, you need to assault the pirate base Platform 42. Nothing really of note here just a brief tank and FPS section. </p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogPlat42.jpg" width="500px">
  <p> Now, you're probably thinkin' "First Sector 42, now platform 42; what's up with that?" Incognito has a lot of references to the book series, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. 42 being defined in the book as "The answer to life the universe and everything". There are also several other nods; such as towels being scattered throughout the episodes and even a secret level referencing the sequel "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". Though I only discovered this by looking through the game's files, I've never found a way to access it; is it even possible? :( </p>

  <p> After repairing all of HEIDI's systems, Nick the Nose boards your ship and shoots Old Man point blank with a shotgun! Somehow, HEIDI is able to transport Old Man to a friendly alien facility where he remains in a coma for about a month. </p>
  
  <p>You wake up on the station, retaining damage to your ocular cybernetics (I guess you got shot in the head 0_0). The station master introduces themselves as a member of the Icicleian species. They explain that their presence is not known in this system, but as a friend of HEIDI, they trust you will not reveal their secret. They help fix your cybernetics and give you free rein to explore the station.</p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogBW.jpg" width="500px"> 
  
  <p>The station's bartender will give you a recorded message from HEIDI. It's very long winded and I honestly can't make out most of what she says. Basically she thanks Old Man for the help and tells him he is now free to do as he wants. As a gift, she gives you a ship for him to captain; the uh ...E621... transport ship and 1000 credits to get him started (even though there is still no money system).  </p>

  <p>The next "merchant" you encounter is a fox, named Fox. This must be the other developer's self-insert. Fox won't say anything, but he will give you a map of Norway (A reference to The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy). If you stand behind Fox, you can see that he is playing LameDuke, an early prototype of Duke Nukem 3D (Groovy!) </p>

  <p> Upon boarding your ...E621... Transport ship, you are immediately back in HEIDI's debt, performing more missions for her as she regains her strength. Specifically you need to collect elements to repair her shields. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogE621.jpg" width="500px"> 
  
  <p> Once you reach the planet for the last required element, Sandvich Guy will hijack your comms. He reveals that his real name is Dreque and that he was the one who put HEIDI out of commission. He explains that HEIDI is evil and needs to be destroyed once and for all. He invites you to his ship to further discuss the matter in private. HEIDI will butt in and accuse him of lying; she asks that you raid an old Alliance station that has data that will prove otherwise. This is the only real branching path in the game. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/SandvichReveal.jpg" width="600px"> 
  
  <p>On my first playthrough, I thought I'd at least hear Sandvich Guy out before making my decision. He welcomes you to his ship and has... Communist Crow escort you to the bridge? The game has already established anthro species, but why is this crow in particular Communist, why do they carry a sword? XD </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/KomradeCrow.jpg" width="500px"> 
  
  <p> Anyway; Sandvich Guy tells you that HEIDI wants to control the world and must be stopped, etc. Since HEIDI trusts you, he asks that you build and plant an EMP bomb on her ship. </p>

  <p>Initially, I suspected that Sandvich Guy had ulterior motives, so everyone on board became hostile. In order to escape you have to loot a code off his corpse and fight your way to the ships' reactor to activate the self destruct. Also, if you were wondering, no; none of the keypads in the game use THE CODE :'( </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSelfDestruct.gif" width="500px"> 
  <p> With Sandvich Guy and Communist Crow out of the way, you head to the facility HEIDI mentioned. Here, the game introduces a new mechanic; some of the doors in this facility are locked and can be blown open using your railgun. By doing this to every door in the facility, I found this secret spinning thing and was able to get out of bounds! </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSecretThing.jpg" width="430px">  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogUnbound.gif" width="430px">  
  <p> The data that HEIDI alluded to does not tell you much, let alone prove her innocence. However, included within the data is a blueprint for super tanks (RTS tanks with massive HP) which will allow you to mine on Sandvich Guy's planet for the shield resource. Regardless of the path you took, the next cutscene will play the exact same. </p>

  <p>Siding with Sandvich Guy is a little more involved; you will need to find a timer and EMP bomb. For the timer, Sandvich Guy sends you to a planet he and his men have been raiding. This is one of the more impressive set-pieces as there is a full scale war going on between two factions. For the most part, the factions will ignore you, allowing you to drive directly to your destination. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSandvichWar.jpg" width="550px"> 
  <p>You find yourself in some kind of industrial facility, after some exploration you will enter a reactor which transports you into a virtual construct. You are greeted by a little green orb dude named Zabut. They explain that Sandvich Guy wiped out their species, and that a few of them were able to survive by uploading their conciseness into a now withering computer. Zabut pleads for you to destroy the construct so that they may all be put to rest; in exchange they will give you the bomb timer. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogZabut.png" width="600px">
  <p>Inside the construct is a rudimentary city. The timer you are looking for lies within a grocery store. Patrolling the city, are these floating ball things that I believe only take damage from your railgun. After you get the timer you have to hack a terminal inside of a house to escape the construct. </p>
   <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogMart.jpg" width="550px">
  <p> Now to destroy the facility. You need to shoot fans around the room and type "Utopia" on a command console which triggers a self-destruct sequence.</p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogBlowIt.jpg" width="550px"> 
  
  <p>For the bomb itself, you delve into a mine shaft on another planet which seemingly spawns an endless hoard of creatures. They aren't very tough, so your machine gun will be enough. Overall, a straight forward mission. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogHorde.jpg" width="550px"> 
  <p> Now all you have to do is go to HEIDI's ship and drop the bomb (like from your inventory) onto the ground.  Regardless of the path you took, the next cutscene will play out exactly the same.</p>

  <p> With Old Man captured by the Alliance, the Icicleians put a reward out for his rescue. Out of everyone we met on our journey, who will come to his rescue!? The furries of course! </p>
  <p>Okay buddy, listen up, you got two choices here; you can be a Wolf (Lup) or a Fox (Vulp). Those are your two choices. (This choice doesn't effect the story; so I won't split the section up)</p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogWolf.jpg" width="440px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogFox.jpg" width="440px"> 
  <p> After choosing a character, the episode starts with you onboard an Icicleian ship. The contact explains that they will be assisting you over comms while you infiltrate the ship and rescue Old Man. </p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogWolf2.jpg" width="430px">   <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogFox2.jpg" width="430px">
  <p>So you go around blasting your way through the ship and find the prison section is blocked off by a security door. To open the door you need to find the door code; there are several copies of it lying around the map, so this shouldn't be any trouble. After breaking into the cell block, you make contact with Old Man but HEIDI is quick to block you off; shielding Old Man and releasing all the prisoners onto you. </p>
  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogWolfHai.gif" width="500px">
  
    <p>Fighting your way out of the cell block, your Icicleian contact explains that you need to enter the virtual world in order to loosen HEIDI's grip. To do this, you need to destroy all the CPU nodes throughout the ship in System Shock 1 fashion. </p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogNode.png" width="500px">
    <p> Before moving on to the virtual world, I want to document a secret room I found in Comms! If you destroy these two computers shown in the left image, a hole will open in the wall. If you can manuver the debris or stack some objects from your inventory (towel and shotgun shells give some good height) you can see through the crack, or if you are fox; you can even manage to squeeze inside! Outside of some pretty loot, inside the room is a picture of an old meme that depcits the same rock in the styleizations of several popular games/media </p>
      <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSecretRoomArea.png" width="450px">  <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogSecretRoom.jpg" width="450px">
    <p> In the virtiual world, HEIDI will surrender but asks that you reason with her. She explains that she is protecting the human for some greater purpouse and that the Alliance has already started firing on the ship. There's alot of inconsitinces here; first she says that Old Man cant leave the ship because he was implanted with nanomachines which will kill him upon escaping, then she asks you to save him by getting him out of here at the cost of your own life? </p>
    <img src="DiverAssets/Desura/Incog/IncogHEIDIEnd.jpg" width="500px">
    <p> So you run back to Old Man while the ship explodes around you and a cutscene shows the ship finally blow up and HEIDI onboard the Iceliean vessel as she laughs and the screen fades to black. Did Old Man and the furry of your choice survive? No one knows! Based on a steam achivement I recived for this; it looks like they were planning to make an Episode 4. I'm thinkin the release date is the same as Half-Life Episode 3 which is [REDACTED] </p>
