  <h2> Background </h2>

  <p> Contuining with the theme of game sites/services, today we will be looking at GameTap.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>GameTap was developed and released by Turner Broadcasting System (A.K.A TBS, the TV channel) in October of 2005. The focus of GameTap was to create a digital distribution network of PC and emulated games via subscription service. Being developed by a broadcasting network, they also included on-demand video of network TV shows as well as their own original programming. Some three years after the launch in 2008, TBS would sell GameTap to Metaboli, a competitor in the european market. Metaboli would continue the service until its shutdown in 2015.</p>

  <h2>A brief history of digital video game subscription models</h2>

  <p>The subscription model of paying a recurring fee over a set cycle for a service has been around for a long time; most notably with magazine/newspaper subscriptions. These examples, are of course all in regard to physical media. For magazines, copies are sent over to your house every cycle; It was not until the 80's when we started to see some of the first examples of digital subscription services. </p>

  <h3>PlayCable 1980-1984</h3>
  <p>The earliest example I could find in the games industry was the 1980's PlayCable for Matel's Intellivision. This service allowed users to download from a rotating monthly library of games via a hardware addition and TV cable connection. The service was also implemented nearly exactly as we know it today as your subscription allowed open access to the month's library! There were technical limitations of course, as the downloaded game was only temporarily stored on the console which meant subsequent plays required a fresh download; however this is still very impressive considering the internet was not even developed yet! Despite this, the PlayCable was unfortunately not very successful and was discontinued around 1984. </p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q-oMtXSVKyU?si=BCYDAITheZYfwrDD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <h3>GameLine 1983-1983?</h3>
  <p>Our second example is GameLine developed in 1983 for the Atari 2600. Unlike the PlayCable, GameLine was more of a digital rental service that allowed subscribers to rent from a library of Atari 2600 games via a hardware addition and dial-up connection. While still impressive for a pre-internet service, it does not seem like GameLine offered as great a value since even after buying the hardware and paying the subscription fee, each game cost an additional rental fee and was only playable for a limited number of plays/credits until the rental fee had to be paid again. I guess you really could say the Atari 2600 brought the arcade to your home XD! </p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EhZ0VEmEKys?si=wXxeQ7Nqn5Z8JGp0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>If you'd like to read more about GameLine, Atari Compendium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230521091537/https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/articles/gameline/gameline.html">(Wayback link)</a> appears to host a first hand account of the service. From what I can gather, the account was originally created for the "Atari 2600 Connection Newsletter". The site seems to have a scan of each print, however the links either do not work or take me to a sketchy warning page. I could find mentions of a physical volume collection of these newsletters around the internet, but it appears no one has made a digital archive. </p>

  <h3>Sega Channel 1994-1998</h3>
  <p>It wouldn't be until the release of Sega Channel for the Sega Genesis in 1994 when we see a more well known take on the model. Nearly identical to PlayCable, Sega Channel allowed subscribers to play from a rotating library of Sega Genesis games via satellite TV connection. Each game could be downloaded and played at no additional cost but still would only be stored on the system temporarily. Unique to Sega Channel however, was that timed demos, digital manuals and cheat codes could also be accessed via the service. According to this archived copy of Broadcasting and Cable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210729113721/https://segaretro.org/index.php?title=File:Broadcasting%26Cable_US_1995-07-10.pdf&page=37">(Wayback link)</a>, there was also a rental system which allowed subscribers to temporarily access newer releases titled "Express games", earlier than than their official integration on the Sega Channel library. </p>

  <h3>Satellaview 1995-2000</h3>
  <p>The last example of the 90's was the Japan exclusive Satellaview released for the Super Famicom in 1995 by Nintendo in partnership with St.GIGA; a Japanese satellite radio broadcasting network. The Satellaview operated via satellite broadcast and offered games, magazines as well as the ability to tune into live audio broadcasts in the form of music, talk shows and voice dubbing! This was referred to as SoundLink. It's unclear exactly how this audio addition worked during the broadcast; I say this because if the broadcast was say, voice acting; this would mean that the player would not only have to tune in at the scheduled time but also somehow sync up their gameplay in real time.</p>

  
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4vM3HBWnRhA?si=fNWLcRMHyu6ePXbS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>Because of the services absence outside of Japan, it is difficult to refer to first hand sources and verify exactly how things were. However, it seems to be widely accepted that to use Satellaview you needed the hardware addition itself which is said to have sold for ¥14,000 (¥15,314.51 calculating for inflation as of writing this, which is $104.75). You would also need a BS receiving satellite dish and tuner, AV selector, AC adapter as well as a subscription fee to St.GIGA's broadcast (I could find no direct sources on this outside of what's been common belief). There was also the BS-X host cartridge, which acted as an interactive virtual hub (referred to as The Town Whose Name Was Stolen), as well as an 8MBit memory card which could be inserted into the host; these are said to have come bundled with the main component but additional 8MBit cards could be purchased separately. </p>

 <h5>Wikimedia Commons <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Satellaview_system.png">(Live Site link) </h5> </a>
 
  <p>Unlike previous examples, the 8MBit storage cartridge allowed games to be stored for later use. This was not all too dissimilar with what Nintendo had done previously in 1986 with the Famicom Disk System which rewrote floppy disks at physical kiosks. 
  While certainly expensive, in theory, one could download an entire library of games using multiple storage cartridges. It's thanks to these cartridges that allowed for some of the Satellaview's exclusive library to be preserved.</p>


 <h3>Metaboli 2002? - 2017?</h3>
  <p>Now to the computer era of digital gaming; The first instance I can find was suprisngly Metaboli! While they will come up multiple times in this dive, at this point in 2002, they were exclusively a French PC games distribution service that offered digital game rentals and a monthy subscription to a digital game library. According to their December 2002 pricing page, they offered a 24 game package for €14.8/month ($24.03 accounting for French inflation) and a premium 32 "Pack Hard Gamer" for €28.8/month ($46.76 accounting for French inflation). EXPENSIVE!  </p>

  <p>Metaboli would soon extend the service to the larger EU market in 2005. While the website cannot be fully navigated, we can see that there was a significant price drop as well as a larger selection of games, 49 games for €6.95/month ($13.11 accounting for UK inflation). It also appears that rentals were completely removed.  </p>

  <h3>Drengin 2003-2004?</h3>
  <p>The second global but first US instance I can find was Stardock's 2003-2004 service, Drengin, which was primarly a games distribution platform for all of Stardock's releases. Subscription allowed access to this service and all of Stardock's current and future releases ("for a year and a half after purchase"). 18 months went for about $70.00 then for the second subscription onwards, $34.95. There is also mention that indie games were distributed, but it is unclear if this was ever implemented due to the service's short lifespan. </p>

<h3>*BONUS* Playaholics 2002-2008 & Fizzy 2007-2016</h3>

  <h3>Gametap 2005-2015</h3>
  <p> Finally in October of 2005, Gametap is offically released in the US. Building upon all of these previous examples.</p>

<p>To launch with a bang, GameTap would sponsor the UK based rock festival, Download's first US event. Held for only one day on October 8th, 2005 at the Shoreline Amphitheater in San Francisco. While coverage of their U.S based events is limited across the board; from an article hosted on their website, we know that in addition to GameTap, sponsors included Napster, Dentine, Amp'd Mobile, and A.I.M.

<h5>Download Festival; August, 2005 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050807021512/http://www.downloadfestival.com/main.html">(Wayback link) </h5> </a>


 
  <h3>Launch Kit pt 1</h3>
  
  
  <p> Back in August of 2023, prior to my knowledge of the Download launch event, I stumbled across an E-Bay listing for a "GameTap Launch Kit" which included a "30-day V.I.P launch card" and Logitech controller. Hoping to learn more about GameTap's launch I quickly made the purchase. Unfortunately however, the package had ended up getting stolen after being delivered. With that, all I had to work with was the photo's provided in the listing which did not tell me much other than there had to have been some kind of physical event where these kits were given out. Still, with a loss of such a unique item, I felt dejected and put this dive on indefinite hiatus. </p>

  <h3>Launch Kit pt 2</h3>
  <h4>Note to self - find a way to scan the paper items </h4>
<p>Skip a year later to late July of 2024, and my interest in contuining this dive is renewed when I was able to learn more about Metaboli's history and the overall timeline of digital game subscription services. Once August came along, I felt hopeful that maybe I could find some kind of unique GameTap memorabilia on eBay again! I nearly jumped out of my chair when I saw a listing for another launch kit, and not only that but with the addition of a GameTap hoodie, scarf and the promise of additional small items!! Again, I immedietly made the purchase without a second thought.  </p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gTapBay.png" height="350px">

<p>This time however, I was determined to not have another peice of histroy lost to a thief, so I messaged the seller with a request to have the delivery require a signature.  Luckily, the package arrived without any issues! The first item is the launch kit itself. It differs slightly in the design of the first one I purchased but overall, all details are the same.</p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gTapbox1.jpg" height="350px"> <img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gTapbox3.jpg" height="350px">

<p>To my suprise, inside the box was not one but two Logitech controllers! I believe the specific model is the "LOGITECH DUAL ACTION G-UF13A". While unrelated to the GameTap narritive, it is interesting to see an older Logitech model like this. It tells a story about the possible patents active at the time. Comparing to my modern Logitech - F310, which has ABXY (green, red, blue and yellow respectively) marked buttons like an Xbox controller, and round containers for the joysticks , these older models have numbered buttons and squared containers for the joysticks. Though all placements are the same. </p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gTapControllers.png" height="350px">


<p>Here's the V.I.P launch card which would have given a one-month subscription when activated. The specific redemption page unforutunately has no functioning archives on the Wayback Machine.</p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/LaunchCardBF.png" height="200px">

<p>Then there's the pamphlet which goes over the basic details of the service. We'll go over this in a later section.</p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/GameTapFlyer1.png" height="350px">
<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/GameTapFlyer2.png" height="350px">





<p>The most significant bonus item is this pamphlet directly from the launch event. It has a performance schedule and a general map of the venue!</p>

<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/HolidayCardBF.png" height="500px">


<p>Extremely grateful for all of these bonus items which were intergral to my research, I confirmed recipet and thanked the seller over eBay. Expressing some suprise at my enthusiasm for GameTap, it turns out that the seller actually worked with GameTap during the launch event! We exchanged contact info and I conducted an informal interveiw over email. </p>



<h3>An interveiw with Chase, Former employee of Access Communications (The PR agency hired by GameTap)</h3>

<h5>"To start, tell me a little about yourself. What's your name, industry background, general interests, etc."</h5>

<p>"My name is Chase, and I've been doing video game PR since 1999. My first 13 years were at Access Communications, a public relations agency where I worked on launching GameTap, SEGA Dreamcast, Twitch, and more than 100 games. I left in 2013 to go in-house at Twitch as their first PR hire. In 2019, I moved to <a href="https://streamelements.com/">StreamElements</a>, where I've been for the past five years." </p>


<h5>"I'd like to know about your first experiences with GameTap. How did you first get involved with them? What was the onboarding process like?" </h5>


<p>"Because we worked on the agency side of GameTap, we were not privy to the company's inner workings. Our job was to generate coverage in the press. This included launching the company and building awareness of each milestone, such as its expanding catalog and new content offerings. Since they sponsored the Download Festival, we were able to attend it and invite select media too, but that was the extent of our presence at the show. I don't have any documents from after 2007, so that is most likely when we stopped working with them. I don't have many client memories since it was so long ago, but I remember loving their promotional shorts, the Space Ghost content, and the Revisioned Tomb Raider project."</p>

  <h2> How Gametap worked</h2>
  <p>If you had a decent PC and internet connection; all you needed for GameTap to work was to subscribe and download the client. While we know the intial price according to the 2005 TV ad was $14.95/month, the site iself in April of 2006 indicates the price was dropped to $9.95/month This subscription granted you access to the GameTap client, their library of games, and GameTapTV.</p>

  <p>When I said previously GameTap built upon the older services we discussed, I was not exaggerating. One source, claims the GameTap library had, Intellivision, Atari 2600, Genesis games and more! The exact breakdown they provide as of April 4th, 2006 is</p>

<p>Like all other digital distribution platforms, nearly everything was tied to the client. This meant websites were primarily for marketing the service and unfortunately for us this means only so much about services like GameTap can be pulled from the web archives alone. Due to GameTap's relative obscurity, depictions of the client are sparse. You can see portions of it throughout video advertisements and various images from news outlets. I was however, able to trackdown a pretty solid lead through a Wing Commander fansite which hosts a variety of pictures of the client as well as some files that GameTap would include (manuals and other goodies). </p>



<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gametapWing.png" width="700px">
<h5>Wing Commander Combat Information Center <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/articles/gametap.shtml">(Live site link) </h5> </a>


  <p> The client is defintely one of the more interesting cases I've seen. It's very interactive and animated; almost the kind of thing you would see on a flash website. The client is split into an account menu, game area and GameTap TV. The game area works on a tiered ring system where each ring is a seperate catagory: favorited games, sorted by genre, etc. Once a game is selected you are greeted with a more standard boxed window with game details, a download/play button, and tabs which seem to grant access to suplimentary game guides and videos.</p>
  
<p> With any game client, one of the most important features is the social system. While the specifics have been lost to time; GameTap's advertising does confirm the service had a friend system; complete with score tracking and an instant messenger, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050712234034/http://www.gametap.com/press/aim.html">intergrating with A.I.M </a>! As you would expect, online multiplayer was defintely possible; but most interesting of all is that GameTap took it's emulation library a step further by developing online play capacities for some of these titles! </p>

<p> I was able to track down the multiplayer system in action from recorded game matches on Youtube, complete with a live chat system built right into the client!</p>

<h2> GameTap TV</h2>

<p> GameTap TV included a wide variety of options; game trailers, music videos, a selection of Network TV shows, and GameTap's own original programming. I was able to track down a pretty comprehensive video of the service on Youtube.</p> 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tRxtirj4PC4?si=9GDETImXRc0rOc3U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> While this part of the client has a neat design; there are a few glaring functional concerns. First of all, there doesn't appear to be any sort of volume control or timeline. The only buttons I noticed, even when the user fullscreened (which is not an actual full screen) are a pause and what I assume to be some kind of previous video button? </p>

<p>More confusing however, is exactly how GameTap TV worked. There are multiple references to the service being "on demand" however, each section the user clicks on brings up a broadcast archive of some sort. Now it's obvious for GameTap original programming such as game trailers, and such; that these are simply hosted videos being watched not all unlike how Youtube worked. However, when it comes to network TV content, it's unclear if these were a mixture of live broadcasts and archived copies of said broadcasts.</p>

<p>Specifically, when the user watches switches to Cartoon Network, there is only one item in the archive titled simply "Cartoon Network" and when clicked, Courage the Cowardly Dog plays, the video starts at some point in the middle of the episode and does not include the previous or pause buttons. But when the user tunes to Mezzo DSA (an Anime Network show) The archive contains individual episodes and when one episode is opened, starts at the beginning with the option to pause. Could GameTap TV have truly included live TV broadcasting? and If so, why was Cartoon Network only accessible via broadcast while Anime Network had on-demand episodes of Mezzo DSA? </p>

<h3> Original programming </h3>
<p> GameTap's original programming primarily consisted of animated comedey sketches, but there were also a few game retrospectives and even mini-documentaries! Luckily it seems that a majority of this content can still be found on GameTap's old YouTube channel. </p>

<p>Out of all the documentarys GameTap produced, the most comprehensive ones are regarding Tomb Raider and Sonic The Hedgehog. This isn't very suprising as both Sonic and Laura Croft often show up in GameTap promotional materials. (I could only find the Sonic documentary in parts, sorry for the clutter!) </p>

<h3> Shutdown </h3>
<p>While still under TBS ownership; GameTap TV was axed sometime around May of 2008. According to an article published by Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/05/turner-shuts-do/">(live site link)</a> this was to focus on the gaming aspect of the service. However, if we are being honest with ourselves; most of the original programming, atleast the comdedy sketches, are not very good :/ </p>
<br>
<hr>

<h2> Free Games and new account model</h2>

<p>Starting in June of 2007, GameTap overhauls its subscription system by establishing 3-tiers of membership. The first tier, Guest, allows anyone from the web to access a small selection of games for free. It's likely that these games were played through the browser. </p>
<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/guest.png" width="250px">

<p>The second tier, Member, was available to anyone who created an account with GameTap. Membership  granted access to a larger library of free games, allowed the use of multiplayer where applicable; and general social aspects such as leaderboards and creating custom game playlists (basically a way to share lists of games with others). The page indicates this would also grant you access to a lite and deluxe client; from what I can figure based on an article from Arstechnica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/gametap-finally-comes-to-the-mac/">(live site link)</a> The lite player was intended for Mac users as patchwork until the deluxe player could be supported. The primary difference was that the lite player did not allow for full screen and controls could not be modified. </p>
<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/member.png" width="250px">
<p> Wait hold on now, I know what you're thinking, free games? Yeah right, What's the catch? Well, based on memory and an article from The Escapist, <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/gametap-launches-ad-supported-free-gaming/">(live site link)</a> GameTap would play ads for anyone accessing free games without a paid membership. However, it's unclear exactly how the ad structure functioned. Did they play the ads prior to loading the game, sporadically throughout gameplay or a combination of both? In addition, games under the Member tier were only temporarily available and frequently changed. </p>

<p> The final membership tier is of course the paid variant, Gold. Gold membership granted access to the full library of games, GameTap TV and removed all ads. It also allowed for parental control and the use of sub accounts (likely a way to save preferences between different local users i.e family).</p>

<p> The main page now segments the games into three catagories "Free games", "Gold Games" and "Games To Buy". Since I could find Deus Ex listed seperately on the gold selection and the buy page; it is my assumption that most if not all games to buy were included in the gold membership.</p>

  <h2> TBS Era  UI/Design history</h2>
 <p> Throughout Gametap's 2 years of operation under TBS; their website underwent a variety of design changes.</p>

  <p> I really like how the GameTap website initally looked. We have greens, blues, oranges, and that really sleek looking white/gray mixture. It's vibrant but also clear and consise. The site's content is also very modular with various info boxes showcasing various features of the service, which makes sense as at this point, the service is still in a launch marketing phase. Navigating the site also reveals a bit of a reliance on Flash, primairly with the main attraction of the site, the tour of the client, which is unforutnatly no longer accessible. </p>


<img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gametapMain2006.png" width="700px">
  <h5> April, 2006 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060811160917/http://www.gametap.com/home/Home">(Wayback link) </h5> </a>

  <p> Minor redesign in October of 2006. Not too much to see due to the limited archive but everything is more centered and blue is incorporated into gradients. It's alot less modular than the original design but it is difficult to say what it would have looked like since they double down with the Flash usage, so the main body of the page is no longer accessible</p>

  <p> Major redesign in June of 2007. The modularity is back but unfortunately most of the archive seems to be incomplete. There's a blue background behind everything and the main window takes on a more beige scheme. One neat feature is how each nav-bar option will light up a different color after the page is selected. Personally I would have also had the color change on mouse hover as well; but maybe they thought it would be too vibrant because they instead opt for a simple background darkening effect. It's also during this redesign that we start to see a shift from marketing to community engagement. We see popular user playlists being featured, a container for recent discussions (likely pulled from the forum, which is accessed via the "Connect" tab in the nav-bar), if you flip around the archives of this design, you will also see various ads featuring GameTap events, and announcements. In this case, a 10 year anniversary retrospective GameTap TV series on Tomb Raider. </p>

  <p> The final design change under TBS occurs around July of 2008 (using a photo of October 2008 as it is better archived). Navigation is greatly simplified but the modulation is still there. The color scheme is still overall bright with primarily white, but there are accents with green highlights on black backgrounds. The biggest change however is the overall page background, as it varies based on current events or game highlights. The picture below showcases Fallout 2, but I've also seen backgrounds for Grimm, etc. Outside of these highlights though, by navigating to nearly any page, you are greeted with a silver gradient background with the gametap logo centered between the three main navigation buttons. Very sleek!   </p>

  <h2>Gametap publishing</h2>
  <p>While overall, gametap seems to have been and remains an obscurity; they did play a small part in video game history by publishing a couple of games. Most notably the Myst MMO, Myst Online: Uru Live, Sam and Max Season 1 and American Mcgee's Grimm. </p>
  
  <p> Something you might notice about all of these games as we go over them is that they are all episodic, meaning that if you purchase the game at release, you will only have access to a portion of its content, with new content being released perodically. This makes sense given TBS's experience with TV; however it's worth noting that the following examples are still in the genre's infancy as the "episodes" while following an overall plot; aren't quite as well tuned to the appeal of an episode game as you can see in developer, Telltale's later releases such as The Walking Dead; which utilizes the portioned episode structure to generate discussion in online fourms about how the story might progress. Think about why the TV show, Lost, was so popular. </p>

  <p> Contuining with the theme of episodic content, GameTap would team up with American Mcgee to publish American Mcgee's Grimm; a game where each episode pertains to a fairy tale but told in Mcgee's typical grim style. The gameplay is hard to catagorize but it's bascially running around an area to spread darkness and make the tales more, you guessed it, grim!</p>

  <h2>Metaboli buyout</h2>

  <p> Not long after the release of American Mcgee's Grimm in September of 2008 TBS sells GameTap to the French company, Metaboli. Still having their French and EU services in play, Metaboli, as far as I'm aware, dominated the entire digital game subscription market!<p>

  <p>Though the transition of ownership would not be immediete. It's not until Around April of  2009 is when we see the first major changes in both the design of GameTap's page as well as membership structure. Like we discussed earlier during Metaboli's introduction, they operated their membership service between packs of games rather than GameTap's single gold membership. The premium teirs are now classic (basically the emulation library) and Premium which is both the classic pack and the rest of the game library. This was likely just a marketing tactic as the price difference was only around $5.00. Though the interesting thing is that they also combined GameTap's oriignal Guest and member tiers into a single free tier.  </p>

  <p> The design of the site doubles down on the prior green highlights on black background, centering the entire site around this theme. But we also see blue, and reddish orange highlights. It's honestly very good looking and sleek. Though the way games are displayed, atleast when selecting a partiuclar genre, leaves a little to be desired as having each game be it's own modular box is a bit clunky. </p>

  <img src="DiverAssets/Gametap/gametapPrice2009.png" width="700px">

  <p> Now this free tier is about when I entered GameTap for the first time I believe. The games I played which were free were Deus Ex, Bloodrayne, Hitman Blood Money, and Psychonauts. <p>

  <p> https://web.archive.org/web/20090403111323/http://www.gametap.com/about-gametap.html there was maybe a desktop client AND a browser plugin. Browser was likely more limited </p>
