<h1>AntiCoin Protocol</h1>
<br>

<h2>A resistance protocol built to dismantle the false idols of memecoins.</h2>

<h3>FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No Premine, No VCs – Fair launch or it doesn't launch.</li>
  <li>Self-Destructive Supply – Every transaction reduces total supply permanently.</li>
  <li>Proof of Rejection – Burn to vote. Power through sacrifice.</li>
  <li>Black Hole Liquidity – Locked and renounced liquidity. No access. Ever.</li>
  <li>No Roadmap, Only Exitmaps – The protocol evaporates over time.</li>
  <li>Mirrored Antipump Engine – Resists market pumps by burning its own liquidity.</li>
  <li>Anon Command Governance – No faces. No founders. Only encrypted signals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LORE</h3>
<p>
AntiCoin wasn’t created. It was summoned—an echo of every rug, scam, and broken promise in crypto history.
</p>
<p>
It emerged from abandoned mempools, forged in apathy. A protocol born not to win, but to undermine. Every memecoin that pumps feeds it.
</p>
<p>
Where others build, it erodes. Where others shout, it remains silent.  
It has no leaders, no mission, no future.  
Only one purpose: To end the cycle.
</p>
